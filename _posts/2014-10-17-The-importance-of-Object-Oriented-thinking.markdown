&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young cyborg it took me a while to understand the concept of object oriented programming and to be completely transparent I may still have some fuzziness in my head about it. Regardless it's a topic of importance to every programmer. Objects in your program are exactly that. Objects in a world that speak and interact with each other. Now how exactly do they do that? A little something called methods and functions. The arguments in the these functions are the topics used in the conversations between these objects.

<br /> <br /> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue that most new programmers (especially me) usually end up having is that we code what we think is there rather than reality because as the ones coding we already know what is going to happen. Problem is the program is question should not. Computers are only as smart as you make them and when it comes to object oriented programming seperation is key. Sometimes it makes sense for things to not know anything about each other. Either that or very limited knowledge of the other. This keeps your code modular and easily expanded. When it comes to a point when your program needs to change itself you would more than likely only need to change a few parts rather than the whole thing.
