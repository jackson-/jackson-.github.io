&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the movies make being a lone wolf seem so cool and let's be honest, it is. Unfortunately this isn't the movies, it's programming. Pair programming has the benefits of bouncing ideas off of another brain that may be thinking way more out of the box than you or vice versa. The problem with being a lone wolf here is someone always gets left behind. Whether it be you or the pack someone experiences a disconnect.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself went through this conundrum on both ends. My team and I were tasked with creating a terminal game of Battleship with a [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) layout. There were a few of us who were extremely good at what we do that left the rest in the dust (namely me, I'm still washing the dust out my clothes). We tried splitting up the work so that we could better handle ourselves and kept in contact through Google Hangouts. The issue came when we were trying to figure out what branches to merge to on GitHub and what problems needed doing. We conversated enough to keep tabs on where the finshed parts of the project were at but not enough for everyone to participate in full effect. There was no screensharing which meant the visual learner that I am was lost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I was on the flip side of the coin. We were tasked with pairing up and making banking software. Unfortunately my partner had left for a urgent errand and I was left the full extent of the project in my hands. I felt like I made some valuable progress in the project on my own side but when my partner returned he had no idea where I was. My pride had stopped me from letting control of the project go at that point and I forced myself to try and finish it on my own. Our teachers stopped the lesson and told us to finish tomorrow so we could move on to other things but in retrospect I was being selfish. Greed never led to the golden pot. So learn from these mistakes young cyborgs. Oh and I almost forgot to tell you. You've just learned a new function: Error Checking!
