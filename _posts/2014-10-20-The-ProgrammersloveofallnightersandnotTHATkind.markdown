&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here I am cyborgs and cybettes(take a look at the homepage for an example of this) at 1 in the morning delivering yet another stream of consciousness for your data processors (or brains whatever). Unfortunately I am feeling a bit fuzzy-brained at the moment. Why? Simply because I've spent the whole of my Sunday programming. My forehead is pounding and if I rub my eyesockets one more time they might just get infected from all the keyboard dust my fingers have accumulated. But it feels so right! I know, I know, I sounded so pessimistic at first so where did that come from? Well let me tell you.
<br /> <br /> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See I've picked up a book some of you may already be aware of called [The Slight Edge](http://slightedge.org/). Self development books have always been a bit iffy for me being that it's usually some touchy feely "have the right attitude and positivity will float your way" crap. Now don't get me wrong I'm all for the bright-eyed personality stuff especially since I tend to fall on that side of the spectrum myself but spare me the charlatan nonsense most of these guys are peddling. This book was different for though as it taught you not to cut the corners. The philosophy behind the slight edge is that the things that help us become successful in life are the little things that are easy to do and easy not to do. What I mean by that is for example: If you know you've got to read 10 pages a day of that "Think Rich" book and you'll be done in a month with the knowledge in hand to make something of yourself it's easy to do. Yet you can just as easily not do it and drown yourself in some pleasure. The issue we have as humans is we like seeing results NOW. The reality though is that in the moment results don't come so quick and whether for better or for worse you'll only notice them when it's too late. If you've been slacking your whole life you'll probably only see the effects when your neck deep in the dirt of society. On the flip side if you keep working your hardest, you won't even notice that you're flying to the top till somebody tells you how lucky you are for all the opportunity you have because you're so focused on the work itself.

<br /> <br /> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the point I'm trying to make here? The little habits you pick up on a daily effect you more than you know. Which is why I'm making a habit of late night/all day coding whenever I can. I'm making the most of every waking moment to give myself The Slight Edge in life. Is this going to get me rich? Is it going to make me successful? To be honest I don't know, but I'm willing to find out. The sad thing is I don't really know many others who are too. If you're experiencing the same thoughts feel free to drop me a line at my email. We can talk about this new function young cyborg: Behavioral Awareness!
