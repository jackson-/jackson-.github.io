		<p>I find that my interests are quite varied and even sometimes odd. Below is a list of resources I have found to be extremely useful in my time. Remember the rule of P.I.E.(Persistent Intelligent Effort) where intelligence is only applied knowledge. So when you're done reading these articles or watching these videos TRY them out. Check out my "Random Output of a Young Cyborg" section for miscellaneous gems and goodies I've stumbled into on the web.</p>

It's built and run by you (the programmers) as part of the Stack Exchange network of Q&A sites. I cannot tell you how many times this site has saved my ass. The wonderful thing about this resource is that it takes full advantage of the internet's community attributes.

        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Neuro Linguistic Programming (often shortened to NLP) is the study of how language effects can instill certain behavior in an individuals mind. I can't particularly point you anywhere but Richard Bandler's books and a good ol' Google search. Be careful on the Google search though as their is a lot of bonafide bull$#!% on the internet about it. I can't force you to believe it when you do your research but just try using it in your daily interactions with people while having an open mind about it. If you test these practices thinking they will fail I guarantee you they will.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
